// Tips for Getting Started: 
//   1. Use the Solution Explorer window to add/manage files
//   2. Use the Team Explorer window to connect to source control
//   3. Use the Output window to see build output and other messages
//   4. Use the Error List window to view errors
//   5. Go to Project > Add New Item to create new code files, or Project > Add Existing Item to add existing code files to the project
//   6. In the future, to open this project again, go to File > Open > Project and select the .sln file

1. To print Hello World to the screen
2. return type, name, parameters, body.
3. main
4. Returns a value for the operating system on windows it's meaningless on unix it is used to decide wheter the program ran sucessfully
5. To turn the source code into binary/compiled code/machine code
6. To make names declared in std_lib_facilities available for the project
7. It means that the inluded file is a header file 
8. It links our object files together to get a running application
9. Source file is program code, written and read by people, object file is binary, wirtten by compilers
10. Integrated Development Environment. Highlights code, autocompletes, makes writing code easier by utilities.
11. Memoires are retained by repetition. Without practice one forgets what he just learned over time.
