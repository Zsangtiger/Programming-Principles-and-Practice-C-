This is a repositry where i upload the drills and excercises i finished from the book named Programming: Principles and Practice using C++

My name is Máté. Online i use my nickname Zsanigtiger. I created this github account to show my code for people interested in it. I am currently looking for a job/internship/ anything. The code i upload here is the drills and excercises from the book Programming: Principles and Practice using C++. If you happened to work through that book right now and you are stuck you might find these files useful. Take a look around. If you liked what you've seen make sure to send an e-mail to my adress takacs0154@gmail.com . Thank you for your time.
